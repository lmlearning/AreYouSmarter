    "reasoning": "Sex ratio imbalance: rare sex has higher fitness (more mates). Frequency-dependent selection favors rare. Rare sex increases until 1:1 equilibrium (Fisher).

    "explanation": "**Tundra** is the biome with permafrost that prevents deep root growth.\n\n**Tundra characteristics:**\n\n**Definition:**\n- Arctic/alpine biome\n- Extremely cold\n- Short growing season\n- **Permafrost**: Permanently frozen ground\n\n**Permafrost:**\n- Soil/rock frozen year-round\n- Ice layer below surface\n- Depth: 10 cm to several meters from surface\n- **Prevents deep roots** - plants can't penetrate\n\n**Option 1 is CORRECT: Tundra** ✓\n\n**Tundra vegetation:**\n\n**Adaptations:**\n- **Shallow roots** (only top layer thaws)\n- Low-growing (wind protection)\n- Perennial (short growing season)\n\n**Plant types:**\n- Mosses, lichens\n- Sedges, grasses\n- Dwarf shrubs (willows, birches)\n- NO TREES (except dwarf willows)\n\n**Why no trees?**\n- Permafrost prevents deep roots\n- Strong winds\n- Short growing season\n- Cold temperatures\n\n**Why other options are WRONG:**\n\n**Option 0: Desert**\n- **NO permafrost**\n- Dry, not frozen\n- Roots CAN go deep (if they find water)\n- Example: Mesquite roots 50+ meters deep\n- Wrong biome\n\n**Option 2: Taiga**\n- **Some frozen ground, but NOT permafrost**\n- Boreal forest (coniferous trees)\n- Trees have DEEP roots\n- Ground thaws in summer\n- Colder than temperate but warmer than tundra\n\n**Option 3: Deciduous forests**\n- **NO permafrost**\n- Temperate climate\n- Ground freezes in winter but thaws completely\n- Trees have DEEP roots\n- Wrong biome\n\n**Tundra types:**\n\n**Arctic tundra:**\n- Northern latitudes (Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland)\n- Continuous permafrost\n- Temperature: -34°C winter, 12°C summer\n- Growing season: 50-60 days\n\n**Alpine tundra:**\n- High mountains (above tree line)\n- Discontinuous permafrost\n- Similar conditions to arctic\n- Found on all continents\n\n**Antarctic tundra:**\n- Limited (mostly ice)\n- Coastal areas\n- Mosses, lichens\n\n**Active layer:**\n\n**Definition:**\n- Top soil layer that thaws in summer\n- 15-50 cm deep typically\n- **Only zone where roots can grow**\n- Refreezes in winter\n\n**Summer:**\n- Active layer thaws\n- Plants grow rapidly\n- Roots confined to this layer\n\n**Winter:**\n- Everything freezes\n- Plants dormant\n- Permafrost continuous\n\n**Environmental features:**\n\n**Tundra:**\n- Permafrost: YES ✓\n- Precipitation: Low (25-40 cm/year)\n- Temperature: Cold (-30 to 10°C)\n- Trees: NO (treeless)\n\n**Taiga:**\n- Permafrost: Patchy/seasonal\n- Precipitation: Moderate (40-100 cm/year)\n- Temperature: Cold (-50 to 20°C)\n- Trees: YES (conifers)\n\n**Desert:**\n- Permafrost: NO\n- Precipitation: Very low (<25 cm/year)\n- Temperature: Hot or cold\n- Trees: Sparse (if any)\n\n**Deciduous forest:**\n- Permafrost: NO\n- Precipitation: High (75-150 cm/year)\n- Temperature: Moderate (-30 to 30°C)\n- Trees: YES (broadleaf)\n\n**Permafrost effects:**\n\n**On plants:**\n- Shallow root systems required\n- Limits plant size\n- Dwarfism common\n- Slow growth rates\n\n**On soil:**\n- Poor drainage (water can't percolate)\n- Waterlogged in summer\n- **Bogs, marshes common**\n- Anaerobic conditions\n\n**On landscape:**\n- Polygonal patterns (ice wedges)\n- Frost heaving\n- Thermokarst (collapse when thawed)\n\n**Global distribution:**\n\n**Tundra (~10% of land):**\n- Arctic circle regions\n- Alpine zones\n- Southern tip of South America\n- High mountains worldwide\n\n**Climate change impacts:**\n\n**Permafrost thawing:**\n- Climate warming\n- Active layer deepening\n- Permafrost degrading\n- **Releases stored carbon** (CO₂, CH₄)\n\n**Consequences:**\n- Infrastructure damage\n- Vegetation changes\n- Carbon feedback (accelerates warming)\n- Shrub expansion (\"greening of Arctic\")\n\n**Biodiversity:**\n\n**Low diversity:**\n- Harsh conditions\n- Short growing season\n- Limited niches\n\n**Animals:**\n- Caribou, musk ox\n- Arctic fox, arctic hare\n- Migratory birds (summer)\n- Insects (brief summer abundance)\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n| Biome | Permafrost | Root depth | Trees |\n|-------|------------|------------|-------|\n| **Tundra** | **YES** ✓ | **Shallow** | NO |\n| Taiga | Patchy | Deep | YES |\n| Desert | NO | Variable/deep | Sparse |\n| Deciduous | NO | Deep | YES |\n\nTundra's defining feature is permafrost, which restricts plant roots to the shallow active layer.",
    "reasoning": "Permafrost = permanently frozen ground. Prevents deep roots. Tundra has permafrost (defining feature) ✓. Desert: no permafrost (hot/dry). Taiga: trees present (roots CAN go deep). Deciduous: temperate (no permafrost). Answer: option 1 (tundra).",
