    "explanation": "Evolution today is viewed as **differential survival and reproduction of the most fit** (natural selection).\n\n**Modern evolutionary theory (Neo-Darwinism/Modern Synthesis):**\n\n**Core definition:**\n- Evolution = change in allele frequencies over time\n- Driven by natural selection, mutation, drift, gene flow\n- **Differential reproductive success**\n- Organisms with advantageous traits → more offspring\n- **THIS IS THE ANSWER** (option 3) ✓\n\n**Key principles:**\n\n**1. Variation exists:**\n- Genetic differences in populations\n- Mutations, recombination create diversity\n\n**2. Heritable traits:**\n- DNA passed to offspring\n- Traits encoded in genes\n\n**3. Differential reproduction:**\n- Some individuals survive/reproduce more\n- **Natural selection**\n- Non-random process\n\n**4. Population changes:**\n- Advantageous alleles increase frequency\n- Over time, population evolves\n\n**Why other options are WRONG:**\n\n**Option 0: Goal-directed**\n- **FALSE - Major misconception**\n- Evolution has NO goal, purpose, or direction\n- Not progressing toward perfection\n- Not teleological\n- No foresight or planning\n- Random mutations + non-random selection\n- Adapts to CURRENT environment only\n\n**Option 1: Selection for acquired characteristics**\n- **LAMARCKISM - Rejected**\n- Lamarck (1800s): organisms acquire traits during lifetime, pass them on\n- Example: Giraffe stretches neck → passes longer neck\n- **WRONG**: DNA not changed by use\n- Weismann barrier: soma doesn't affect germline\n- Modern: Only genetic changes inherited\n\n**Option 2: Synonymous with gene flow**\n- **TOO NARROW**\n- Gene flow is ONE mechanism of evolution\n- Gene flow = migration, alleles moving between populations\n- But evolution also includes: selection, mutation, drift\n- Not synonymous\n\n**Five mechanisms of evolution:**\n\n**1. Natural selection:**\n- Non-random differential reproduction\n- Adapts populations to environment\n- Only mechanism that creates adaptation\n\n**2. Mutation:**\n- Creates new alleles\n- Ultimate source of variation\n- Random with respect to fitness\n\n**3. Genetic drift:**\n- Random sampling error\n- Allele frequencies fluctuate by chance\n- Stronger in small populations\n- Bottleneck, founder effects\n\n**4. Gene flow:**\n- Migration between populations\n- Introduces alleles\n- Homogenizes populations\n\n**5. Non-random mating:**\n- Inbreeding, assortative mating\n- Changes genotype frequencies\n- Affects Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n\n**Differential survival and reproduction:**\n\n**Example: Peppered moths**\n- **Before pollution**: Light moths camouflaged, survive better\n- **After pollution**: Dark moths camouflaged, survive better\n- **Differential survival** → population changes\n- Proportion of dark moths increased\n- Evolution occurred\n\n**Example: Antibiotic resistance**\n- **Bacteria without resistance**: Killed by antibiotic\n- **Bacteria with resistance**: Survive, reproduce\n- **Differential reproduction**\n- Resistant bacteria dominate population\n- Evolution in action\n\n**Fitness:**\n- Reproductive success\n- Number of surviving offspring\n- Relative to other individuals\n- Context-dependent (environment-specific)\n\n**Natural selection types:**\n- **Directional**: Favors one extreme (giraffe neck length)\n- **Stabilizing**: Favors average (human birth weight)\n- **Disruptive**: Favors extremes (beak sizes)\n- **Sexual**: Mate competition/choice\n\n**Evolution is NOT:**\n- Goal-directed (no purpose)\n- Progress toward perfection (no goal)\n- Ladder/chain of being (branching tree)\n- Lamarckian (acquired traits not inherited)\n- Just one mechanism (multiple forces)\n\n**Evolution IS:**\n- Change in allele frequencies\n- Driven by multiple mechanisms\n- **Primarily natural selection** (adaptation)\n- Differential reproductive success\n- Response to current environment\n- Ongoing process\n\nEvolution is differential survival and reproduction, where better-adapted individuals leave more offspring.",
    "reasoning": "Modern evolution = differential reproduction (natural selection). Not goal-directed (no purpose). Not Lamarckian (acquired traits not inherited). Not just gene flow (one of many mechanisms). Natural selection = non-random survival/reproduction. Answer: option 3 (differential survival/reproduction).",

    "explanation": "DDT-resistant mosquitoes appeared because **some mosquitoes were already resistant when DDT was first used**.\n\n**How pesticide resistance evolves:**\n\n**Pre-existing variation (CORRECT):**\n- Random mutations occur naturally\n- BEFORE pesticide exposure\n- Create genetic diversity\n- Some individuals happen to have resistance allele\n- **Very rare initially** (maybe 1 in 10,000)\n- **Natural selection acts on existing variation**\n\n**What happened with DDT:**\n\n**1. Before DDT (pre-1944):**\n- Mosquito population has variation\n- Most: susceptible (SS)\n- **Few: resistant (RR or RS)** - already present\n- Resistance allele at low frequency (~0.001%)\n- No advantage (no DDT)\n\n**2. DDT introduced (1944 onward):**\n- DDT used widely in India\n- **Selective pressure applied**\n- Susceptible mosquitoes: Die\n- **Resistant mosquitoes: Survive**\n\n**3. Selection acts (1944-1959):**\n- Each generation: resistant proportion increases\n- Differential survival\n- Resistant allele frequency rises\n- 15 years: Resistance becomes common\n\n**4. By 1959:**\n- Resistant mosquitoes dominate\n- DDT effectiveness reduced\n- Evolution observed\n\n**Option 1 is CORRECT:**\n\"Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first used\" ✓\n- Pre-existing genetic variation\n- Selection acted on existing alleles\n- Classic natural selection\n\n**Why other options are WRONG:**\n\n**Option 0: Mutation AFTER exposure**\n- **COMMON MISCONCEPTION**\n- Implies directed mutation (Lamarckian)\n- Mutations don't occur \"because\" of pesticide\n- Mutations are RANDOM\n- Occur before selection, not in response\n- Selection acts on pre-existing variation\n\n**Option 2: DDT generally effective, only selective breeding helps**\n- **IRRELEVANT/CONFUSING**\n- Doesn't explain wild population resistance\n- Selective breeding is artificial selection\n- Not explaining natural evolution\n\n**Option 3: Ineffective against mosquitoes specifically**\n- **FACTUALLY WRONG**\n- DDT WAS very effective initially\n- Killed 95-99% of mosquitoes\n- That's WHY it was used\n- Resistance evolved BECAUSE it was effective (strong selection)\n\n**Timeline of DDT:**\n- **1939**: DDT synthesized (Paul Hermann Müller)\n- **1944**: Used in WWII (typhus, malaria control)\n- **1945-1960s**: Widespread agricultural use\n- **1950s-1960s**: Resistance appears (mosquitoes, flies, etc.)\n- **1962**: \"Silent Spring\" (Rachel Carson) - environmental concerns\n- **1972**: DDT banned in USA\n\n**DDT resistance mechanisms:**\n\n**Genetic basis:**\n- **kdr mutation**: Voltage-gated sodium channel\n- Target site insensitivity\n- DDT can't bind properly\n- Pre-existing rare mutation\n\n**Metabolic resistance:**\n- Enhanced detoxification enzymes\n- Cytochrome P450s\n- Break down DDT faster\n\n**Behavioral resistance:**\n- Avoid sprayed surfaces\n- Feed outdoors instead of indoors\n\n**Natural selection criteria:**\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. **Variation** - Different resistance levels ✓\n2. **Heritability** - Resistance gene passed on ✓\n3. **Differential reproduction** - Resistant survive more ✓\n4. **Time** - Multiple generations ✓\n\n**This is textbook natural selection**\n\n**Other examples:**\n- **Antibiotic resistance**: Bacteria (same mechanism)\n- **Herbicide resistance**: Weeds\n- **Warfarin resistance**: Rats\n- **Heavy metal tolerance**: Plants\n\nAll follow same pattern: pre-existing variation + selection\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n**Implications:**\n- Pesticide resistance is inevitable\n- Happens faster with overuse\n- Need integrated pest management\n- Rotation of pesticides\n- Understanding evolution prevents resistance\n\n**Misunderstanding evolution:**\n- Leads to pesticide/antibiotic overuse\n- Accelerates resistance\n- Public health crisis\n\nResistance evolved because rare resistant individuals were already present and survived DDT treatment.",
    "reasoning": "Pre-existing variation + selection = evolution. Some mosquitoes had resistance mutation BEFORE DDT (random mutation). DDT killed susceptible, resistant survived.

Chromosome structure:**\n- Humans: 23 chromosome pairs\n- Chimps: 24 chromosome pairs\n- Human chromosome 2 = fusion of two chimp chromosomes\n- Telomeres in middle of human chr 2 (evidence of fusion)\n\n**3. Pseudogenes:**\n- Non-functional genes\n- Same pseudogenes in same locations\n- Example: Vitamin C synthesis gene (broken in both)\n- Same mutations = common ancestry\n\n**4.
